# Synonym_Engine
This project is a Synonym Retrieval System built in Python that integrates:

Microsoft SQL Server (for persistent synonym data)

Redis (for caching query results)

pyODBC (to connect Python to SQL Server)

dotenv (to manage secure environment configs)

VS Code + Git for development and version control

ðŸš€ What This Project Does
Connects to a Microsoft SQL Server database and retrieves all synonym entries.

Caches the full synonym dataset in Redis with a TTL (time-to-live) of 1 hour.

Returns cached data on subsequent runs, reducing database load.

Uses .env file to securely store connection details for both SQL Server and Redis.

âœ… What I Did
âœ… Set up Microsoft SQL Server Express and created a database with a synonyms table.

âœ… Populated the database with example synonym entries.

âœ… Installed and configured Redis using Docker for caching.

âœ… Wrote modular Python code:

main.py â€“ Orchestrator script

db_utils.py â€“ Fetches data from SQL Server

cache_utils.py â€“ Manages Redis cache

âœ… Integrated .env file support using python-dotenv

âœ… Handled edge cases like invalid connections and cached errors

âœ… Debugged connection issues including:

SQL Server TCP/IP port settings

SQL Server Browser and instance naming

âœ… Used Git and GitHub for version control and project tracking
